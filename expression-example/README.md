This module provides an example expression that can be used in a Gateway or Designer/Client. The actual expression code is located in the MultiplyFunction class. The GatewayHook, DesignerHook and ClientHook classes all reference this expression class in their configureFunctionFactory() methods. To see the expression in action, start a Designer and add a label to a window. Click on the label's Text 'Bind Property' button. In the Property Binding window, select the Expression option and add 
<code>exampleMultiply(4, 6)</code>
to the window. Click OK. The label will now use the custom expression as its text.
